This package is running with the NEURON simulation program written by Michael
Hines and available on internet at:
  http://www.neuron.yale.edu

The package contains mechanisms (.mod files) and programs (.oc files) needed to
simulate single-compartment models of cortical neurons.  Details of the
kinetics of currents are given in:

  PROGRAMS
  ========

demo_PY_RS.oc  : regular-spiking pyramidal neuron
demo_PY_LTS.oc : bursting pyramidal neuron (LTS cell)
demo_IN_FS.oc  : fast-spiking interneuron


  MECHANISMS
  ==========

 HH2.mod		: fast sodium spikes (Na and K currents)
 IM.mod 		: slow voltage-dependent potassium current (IM)
 IT.mod 		: T-type calcium current
 cadecay.mod		: intracellular calcium dynamics


  HOW TO RUN
  ==========

Use autolaunch on modeldb or:

unix platform:

To compile the demo, NEURON and INTERVIEWS must be installed and working on
the machine you are using.  Just type "nrnivmodl" to compile the mechanisms
given in the mod files.

Then, execute the main demo program by typing:

  nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin platform:

  Compile the mechanism (mod) files by using mknrndll.  Then start the simulation
  by clicking on mosinit.hoc in windows explorer.

back to any platform:

Once the menu and graphics interface has appeared, select a simulation from the
"Simulations of cortical cells" window.  Reposition the windows to find the
Run Control window.   Then click on "Init and Run" button to start the simulation...

7/11/2005 Changes added which removes electrode on subsequent simulations.
Note: 3/9/2002 Michael Hines made non-substantive changes to allow the
3 demos to run in the same NEURON process. Thus the original button panel
was replaced by a radio button panel, and any files which should only
be opened once per NEURON launch are now opened via load_file instead
of xopen. Lastly, before the gui for each demo is started the previous
gui is erased with the restart() procedure which was added to
rundemo.hoc

20120109 updated SOLVE method in cadecay.mod to derivimplicit and IM.mod,
IT.mod to cnexp as per
