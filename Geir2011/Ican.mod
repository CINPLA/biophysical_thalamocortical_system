TITLE Slow Ca-dependent cation current
:
:   Ca++ dependent nonspecific cation current ICAN
:   Differential equations
:
:   This file was taken the study of Zhu et al.: Neuroscience 91, 1445-1460, 1999,
:   where kinetics were based on Partridge & Swandulla, TINS 11: 69-72, 1988

:   Modified by Geir Halnes, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, June 2011
:   (using only 1 of the two calcium pools applied by Zhu et al. 99)
